    "\n",
    "In this project, you will implement a program to encrypt and decrypt text using Caesar Cipher. The cipher is one of the oldest and simplest known encryption techniques known. It simply relies on substituting each character in a string by another character which is shifted by a certain number of places. For example, with a shift of 1 'a' becomes 'b', 'e' becomes 'f', and 'z' becomes 'a'. In the Caesar cipher, all characters are shifted by the same number of places and we refer to the shift value as key. \n",
    "\n",
    "To decrypt a message, you simply use the same key, which was used during the encryption procedure, to shift the characters back the same number of places. For example, with a key = 1 'b' becomes 'a', 'f' becomes 'e', and 'a' becomes 'z'. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are 26 letters in English, there are only 25 keys available for Caesar cipher. Therefore, it is easy to decipher a message without knowing the key. Simply use all possible keys to decrypt a message then read the outputs till one of them makes sense. This process is also implemented in the project.\n"
