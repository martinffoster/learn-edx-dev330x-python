    "You have seen many error messages generated by your programs. In Python (and many other languages), errors are also called exceptions, and they have many types. Let's examine an exception (error) and discuss the error message associated with it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> 5/0\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The last line indicates that the exception is of type `ZeroDivisionError`, and also indicates that it was raised by a division by zero (5/0), which is mathematically intractable. The penultimate line indicates that the exception source is in line 1 of your code. If the expression was part of a larger code, the line number would reflect the source of the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to `ZeroDivisionError`, the Python standard library supports many exception types. In the following examples, you will see some exception types that you might have encountered already. More information about the built-in exception types is available from the Python Documentation site at https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#bltin-exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, when Python encounters an error of any type it raises an exception. The exception then propagates through the calling function and upper-level functions until it's dealt with. As a programmer, you can decide what to do when an exception is raised--you can either pass it to another level or handle it. In the next section, you will explore methods of handling different types of exceptions."

    "\n",
    "There are situations in which you want your code to continue execution or display a friendly message to the user despite an error that you might or might not anticipate in advance. It is possible to modify your program to handle specific exceptions and to continue execution without stopping. The process is called exception handling, and can be done using a `try...except` statement with the following syntax:\n",

    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Handling unexpected exceptions\n",
    "If your code encounters an exception you did not anticipate or explicitly handle, your program will stop execution and display an error message. You can handle unexpected exceptions using an `except` clause without specifying the exception type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling exceptions raised by other functions\n",
    "When a function raises an exception without handling it, the caller function must handle the exception or raise it up another level. For example, the `sqrt` function from the `math` module expect a positive number for an argument. Passing a negative number to `sqrt` will raise a `ValueError` exception. The `sqrt` function doesn't handle the exception internally, so your code should handle it or raise it to an upper level.\n",
